`n8n-workflow-sync` is a command line tool to list and create workflows on an n8n instance. It aims to let you version control workflows locally and sync them via the n8n REST API.

## Installation

Pre-built binaries are available on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/dunctk/n8n-workflow-sync/releases). Currently we publish a macOS (Intel) build generated by our GitHub Actions workflow. To install:

1. Download the `n8n-workflow-sync-macos` asset from the latest release.
2. Mark it as executable: `chmod +x n8n-workflow-sync-macos`.
3. Move it somewhere on your `PATH`, for example:

   ```bash
   mv n8n-workflow-sync-macos /usr/local/bin/n8n-workflow-sync
   ```

Support for additional operating systems will be added in future releases.

## Usage

Set the following environment variables so the CLI can authenticate with your n8n server:

```bash
export N8N_HOST=https://your.n8n.instance/
export N8N_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

Then run `n8n-workflow-sync` with one of the available subcommands:

```bash
# List workflows
n8n-workflow-sync list

# Create a new workflow
n8n-workflow-sync new "My Flow"

# Download an existing workflow
n8n-workflow-sync pull 123 workflow.json

# Upload changes back to n8n
n8n-workflow-sync push 123 workflow.json
```
